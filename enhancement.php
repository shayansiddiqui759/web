                <h3>Horizontal Scrolling for Service Card Section</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented a horizontal scrolling feature for the <a href="index.php"></a> Service Section on
                    the index.html page.
                    This enhancement provides an elegant way to showcase multiple services when there are more than
                    three service cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The service cards are displayed within a horizontal scrolling container, allowing users to
                    effortlessly navigate through
                    the services using a horizontal scroll bar.
                </p>
